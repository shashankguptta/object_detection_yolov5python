YOLOv5 Object Detection
This repository contains an implementation of YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art object detection model, for detecting objects in images. YOLOv5 is known for its high performance and accuracy in real-time object detection tasks.
Features

    YOLOv5 implementation for object detection
    Support for PyTorch, ONNX, CoreML, and TFLite
    Easy integration with other frameworks and tools
    Efficient and fast object detection capabilities

Prerequisites

    Python installed on your system
    PyTorch, ONNX, CoreML, and TFLite libraries

Installation

    Clone the repository to your local machine:

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/yolov5-object-detection.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd yolov5-object-detection

Usage

    Run the YOLOv5 object detection script:

    python detect_objects.py

    The script will use the YOLOv5 model to detect objects in images.
    Customize the script to work with your specific dataset or requirements.

Example

python detect_objects.py --image image.jpg
